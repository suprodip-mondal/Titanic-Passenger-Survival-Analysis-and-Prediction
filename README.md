# Titanic-Passenger-Survival-Analysis-and-Prediction
This project uses the Titanic dataset to predict passenger survival through a complete machine learning workflow.

The process includes:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to visualize data distributions and identify missing values.

Data cleaning and preprocessing, which involves imputing missing 'Age' values and converting categorical features like 'Sex' and 'Embarked' into a numerical format.

Training and comparing three distinct classification models:

Logistic Regression,
Random Forest,
Gradient Boosting 

Model evaluation using metrics like Precision, Recall, and F1-Score, along with a comparative ROC curve to visualize AUC scores
